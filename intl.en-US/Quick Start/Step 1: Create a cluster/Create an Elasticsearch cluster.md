# Create an Elasticsearch cluster

This topic describes how to create an Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch cluster.

-   An Alibaba Cloud account is created.

    Click to [create an Alibaba Cloud account](https://account.alibabacloud.com/register/intl_register.htm).

-   A Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) and a VSwitch are created.

    For more information, see [Create a VPC and a VSwitch](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Preparations/Create a VPC and a VSwitch.md).

-   The specifications and storage capacity of your cluster are evaluated.

    For more information, see [Evaluate specifications and storage capacity](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Preparations/Evaluate specifications and storage capacity.md).


1.  Go to the [Elasticsearch cluster buy page](https://common-buy-intl.alibabacloud.com/?commodityCode=elasticsearch_intl#/buy).

2.  On the buy page, complete cluster launch configurations.

    This tutorial uses an example of version 6.7. For other configurations, please customize the selection. For more information of configuration parameters, see [Parameters on the buy page](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 1: Create a cluster/Parameters on the buy page.md).

3.  Click **Buy Now**.

4.  After the cluster is created, click **Console** to go to the **Overview** page of the Elasticsearch console.

5.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Elasticsearch Clusters** to view the created Elasticsearch cluster.


After the state of the cluster changes from **Initializing** to **Active**, you can configure or access the cluster. For more information, see [Step 2 \(optional\): Configure a cluster](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 2 (optional): Configure a cluster.md) or [Step 3: Access a cluster](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 3: Access a cluster.md).
