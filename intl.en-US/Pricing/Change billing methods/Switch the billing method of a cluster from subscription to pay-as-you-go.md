# Switch the billing method of a cluster from subscription to pay-as-you-go

After you create a subscription Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch or Logstash cluster, you can switch its billing method to pay-as-you-go to save costs. This way, you can use the Elasticsearch or Logstash cluster more flexibly. After the billing method of the cluster is switched to pay-as-you-go, make sure that your account balance is sufficient. If your account balance is insufficient, overdue payments may occur, which affects your services.

The Elasticsearch or Logstash cluster whose billing method you want to switch is in the Active or Expired state.

## Precautions

Before you switch the billing method of a cluster from subscription to pay-as-you-go, take note of the following items:

-   The cluster is not released after the billing method is switched to pay-as-you-go. Make sure that your account balance is sufficient. If your account balance is insufficient, the cluster may be suspended due to overdue payments. If you no longer want to use the cluster, back up the data stored on the cluster and manually release the cluster in the console.
-   After you switch the billing method from subscription to pay-as-you-go, you receive a refund for the remaining balance of the subscription. You are charged a service fee of 15% of the refund for the billing method switching.
-   After the billing method is switched to pay-as-you-go, the system refunds the remaining amount of the subscription and stored-value cards to the original payment account. Coupons and vouchers cannot be refunded.
-   If the cluster has pending renewal or upgrade orders, a full refund is returned to the original payment account.
-   Renewals offered by Alibaba Cloud due to Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filings, errors, or server room migration cannot be refunded.
