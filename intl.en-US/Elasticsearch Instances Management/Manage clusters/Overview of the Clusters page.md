# Overview of the Clusters page

The Clusters page of Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch displays the basic information of Elasticsearch clusters. This page also allows you to create clusters, configure alerting, bind tags to clusters, update cluster statuses, export a cluster list, customize a cluster list, and manage clusters.

Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch console](https://partners-intl.elasticsearch.console.aliyun.com/#/home). In the left-side navigation pane, click **Elasticsearch Clusters**. The **Clusters** page appears. This page shows all Elasticsearch clusters in the current region under your account. You can perform the following operations on this page.

|Operation|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|View the cluster list|You can choose columns you want to display in the cluster list. The cluster list includes these columns: **Cluster ID/Name**, **Tag**, **Status**, **Version**, **Cluster Type**, **Data Nodes**, **Cluster Specification**, **Zone**, **Billing Method**, and **Created At**.|
|View basic cluster information|Click a cluster ID in the **Cluster ID/Name** column to navigate to the **Basic Information** page. For more information, see [View the basic information of a cluster](/intl.en-US/Elasticsearch Instances Management/Manage clusters/View the basic information of a cluster.md).|
|Create a cluster|Click **Create** to navigate to the buy page and create a cluster. For more information, see [Create an Elasticsearch cluster](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 1: Create a cluster/Create an Elasticsearch cluster.md).|
|Enable/disable alerting|You can click **Alarms** to enable the alerting feature for Elasticsearch in the Cloud Monitor console. By default, this feature is disabled. After you enable it, Cloud Monitor creates alert rules to detect exceptions such as abnormal cluster status, high disk usage \(\> 75%\), and high JVM heap memory \(\> 85%\). These rules are applied to all Elasticsearch clusters under your Alibaba Cloud account. For more information, see [Configure the monitoring and alerting feature in CloudMonitor](/intl.en-US/Elasticsearch Instances Management/Cluster monitoring and alerting/Configure the monitoring and alerting feature in CloudMonitor.md).|
|Bind tags to clusters|If you have a large number of Elasticsearch clusters, you can bind tags to them for easy management. A tag is composed of a key-value pair. You can use keys and values to further classify clusters. For more information, see [Manage cluster tags](/intl.en-US/Elasticsearch Instances Management/Manage clusters/Manage cluster tags.md).|
|Update cluster status|Click the **Refresh** icon in the upper-right corner to update the statuses of Elasticsearch clusters. After an Elasticsearch cluster is created, it is in the **Initializing** state. You can click the **Refresh** icon to update the status of the cluster. After the **Status** of the cluster changes to **Active**, you can use the cluster.|
|Export the cluster list|The export feature allows you to customize a cluster list and export it. Click the ![Download icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/4587659951/p86100.png) icon in the upper-right corner. In the **Export** dialog box, specify **Export Mode** and **Translate Heading**, select the columns you want to export, and click **OK**. -   **Export Mode**: the mode that is used to export the cluster list. Valid values: All and Selected. Default value: All.
-   **Translate Heading**: specifies whether to translate headings. Valid values: Yes and No. Default value: **Yes**. If you set this parameter to **Yes**, exported headings are in Chinese. If you set this parameter to **No**, exported headings are in English, such as instanceId and description.
-   **Custom**: customizes the columns to export: **Cluster ID**, **Cluster Name**, **Tag**, **Version**, **Cluster Type**, **Data Nodes**, **Specification**, **Zone**, **Billing Method**, **Created At**, **VPC ID**, and **Network Type**. By default, all these columns are exported. You can also select columns as required. |
|Customize a cluster list|Click the ![Customize a cluster list](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/5587659951/p86107.png) icon in the upper-right corner. In the **Select Filters** dialog box, select columns as required. **Cluster ID/Name** and **Actions** are dimmed. You cannot select or clear them.|
|Manage clusters|Click **Manage** in the **Actions** column. On the page that appears, you can perform operations such as upgrading the cluster, viewing logs, configuring security settings, and configuring plug-ins.|
|Switch to subscription|This feature applies only to pay-as-you-go clusters. Find your cluster, click **More** in the **Actions** column, and select **Switch to Subscription**. On the **Confirm Order** page, change the billing method of the cluster.|
|Update the configuration of a cluster|Find your cluster, click **More** in the **Actions** column, and select **Update Configuration** to navigate to the **Update** page. Then, modify the cluster configuration. For more information, see [Upgrade the configuration of a cluster](/intl.en-US/Elasticsearch Instances Management/Upgrade or downgrade a cluster/Upgrade the configuration of a cluster.md).|
|Release a cluster|This feature applies only to pay-as-you-go clusters. Find your cluster, click **More** in the **Actions** column, and select **Release**. In the **Release** message, click OK. **Warning:** After a cluster is released, all data on the cluster cannot be recovered. We recommend that you back up data before you release a cluster. For more information, see [Commands for creating snapshots and restoring data](/intl.en-US/Elasticsearch Instances Management/Data backup/Commands for creating snapshots and restoring data.md). |
