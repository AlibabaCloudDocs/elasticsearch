# Create an Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch cluster

This topic describes how to create an Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch cluster.

-   An Alibaba Cloud account is created.

    To create an Alibaba Cloud account, visit the [account registration page](https://account.alibabacloud.com/register/intl_register.htm).

-   A virtual private cloud \(VPC\) and a vSwitch are created.

    For more information, see [Create a VPC and a VSwitch](/intl.en-US/Elasticsearch Instances Management/Quick Start/Preparations/Create a VPC and a VSwitch.md).

-   The specifications and storage capacity of your cluster are evaluated.

    For more information, see [Evaluate specifications and storage capacity]().
