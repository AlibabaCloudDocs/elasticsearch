# Release a cluster

You can only release pay-as-you-go clusters or subscription clusters that have expired. If a subscription cluster has not expired, you must claim a refund before you release the cluster. This topic describes how to release a pay-as-you-go cluster.

After a cluster is released, data in the cluster cannot be restored. We recommend that you back up data before you release a cluster. For more information, see [Commands to create snapshots and restore data](/intl.en-US/Elasticsearch Instances Management/Data backup/Commands for creating snapshots and restoring data.md).

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch console](https://elasticsearch.console.aliyun.com/#/home).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where your cluster resides.

3.  In the top navigation bar, select a resource group and a region.

4.  On the **Clusters** page, find the cluster that you want to release and choose **More** \> **Release** in the **Actions** column.
