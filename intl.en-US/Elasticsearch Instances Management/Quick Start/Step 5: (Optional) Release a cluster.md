# Step 5: \(Optional\) Release a cluster

If you no longer require a cluster, you can release the cluster. After the cluster is released, you are no longer charged for the cluster. In addition, the data in the cluster is deleted and can no longer be recovered.

Snapshots are created. For more information, see [Create manual snapshots and restore data from manual snapshots](/intl.en-US/Elasticsearch Instances Management/Data backup/Create manual snapshots and restore data from manual snapshots.md).

You can follow the instructions provided in this topic to release only pay-as-you-go clusters.
