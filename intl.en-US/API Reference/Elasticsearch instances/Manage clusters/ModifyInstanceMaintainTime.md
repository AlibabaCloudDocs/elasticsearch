# ModifyInstanceMaintainTime

You can call this operation to change and enable the maintenance window of an instance.

Note the following before calling this operation:

-   Before maintenance is performed, the system sends SMS messages and emails to the contacts listed in your Alibaba Cloud account.
-   To ensure smooth maintenance, your Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch cluster enters the **Initializing** state prior to the maintenance window. In this case, you can still access the cluster and perform query operations such as performance monitoring. However, you cannot perform modification operations such as restart and configuration upgrades for the cluster.
-   Make sure that you configured automatic reconnection policies for your applications because the cluster may experience transient disconnections within the maintenance window.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=elasticsearch&api=ModifyInstanceMaintainTime&type=ROA&version=2017-06-13)
