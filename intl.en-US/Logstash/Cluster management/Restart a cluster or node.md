# Restart a cluster or node

If you modify the configurations or other information of a cluster or node, you may need to restart the cluster for the modifications to take effect. This topic describes how to restart a Logstash cluster or node in the console.

**Status** of the cluster is **Active**, and resource usages are not high.

**Note:** Example: **NodeCPUUtilization\(%\)** is about 80%, **NodeHeapMemoryUtilization\(%\)** is about 50%, and **NodeLoad\_1m** is less than the number of CPU cores of the current data node. To view resource usages, click the cluster ID in the Cluster ID/Name column. Then, click **Cluster Monitoring** in the left-side navigation page of the cluster details page. For more information, see [Configure the monitoring and alerting feature in CloudMonitor](/intl.en-US/Logstash/Cluster monitoring/Configure the monitoring and alerting feature in CloudMonitor.md).

## Restart a Logstash cluster or node

You can restart a cluster or node as required. A cluster restart refers to the restart of all nodes in a cluster. However, a node restart refers to the restart of a single node. The precautions and operations for a Logstash cluster or node restart are similar to those of an Elasticsearch cluster or node restart. For more information, see [Restart a cluster or node](/intl.en-US/Elasticsearch Instances Management/Manage clusters/Restart a cluster or node.md).
