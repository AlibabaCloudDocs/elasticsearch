Before your subscription Alibaba Cloud Logstash cluster is automatically released, you can manually renew the cluster to extend its validity period. This topic describes how to manually renew a Logstash cluster.

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch console](https://elasticsearch.console.aliyun.com/#/home).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where your cluster resides.

3.  On the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and perform one of the following operations:

    -   In the **Actions** column, click **More** and select **Renew**.
    -   In the **Cluster ID/Name** column, click its ID. On the **Basic Information** page, click **Renew**.
4.  On the **Renew** page, specify **Renewal Duration**.

    A cluster is renewed on a monthly basis.
