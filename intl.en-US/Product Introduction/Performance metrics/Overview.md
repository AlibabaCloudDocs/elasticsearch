# Overview {#concept_1443291 .concept}

This topic lists the results of benchmarking Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch clusters V5.5.3 in the China \(Hangzhou\) region by using Rally benchmarking scripts provided by official Elasticsearch. These clusters have different specifications.

Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch clusters with the following specifications are benchmarked.

-   [Three 4-core 16 GB nodes](reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Performance metrics/Three 4-core 16 GB nodes.md#)
-   [Three 2-core 8 GB nodes](reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Performance metrics/Three 2-core 8 GB nodes.md#)
-   [Three 8-core 32 GB nodes](reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Performance metrics/Three 8-core 32 GB nodes.md#)

We have also compared the benchmarks of a 4-core 16 GB node cluster and a 2-core 8 GB node cluster. For more information, see [Benchmark comparison between 4-core 16 GB and 2-core 8 GB nodes](reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Performance metrics/Benchmark comparison between 4-core 16 GB and 2-core 8 GB nodes.md#).
