# Scenarios

Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch is suitable for a wide range of scenarios, such as integrated monitoring, intelligent operation and maintenance \(O&M\), information retrieval, and data intelligence.

## Integrated monitoring and intelligent O&M

In complex business scenarios, large amounts of metrics, logs, and application performance monitoring \(APM\) data of different structures and types exist on various devices. This brings great challenges to end-to-end exception identification, business analysis, and business O&M. The devices include servers, physical machines, Docker containers, mobile devices, and IoT sensors. In these scenarios, it is difficult for users to obtain useful information from the logs, but they are still charged for the high storage costs of the logs.

Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch allows you to use its services, such as Beats and Logstash, to connect to various data sources. This way, it can provide scalable, centralized collection capabilities and out-of-the-box storage and analysis capabilities for the data sources. The Kibana service provided by Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch allows you to efficiently create dashboards for data visualization and O&M. You can configure items, such as hostnames, IP addresses, deployment statuses, and display colors, in the dashboards. This helps you quickly identify issues from large amounts of logs, improves troubleshooting efficiency, and makes the logs more useful.

## Information searches

Searches for various information occur every day on the mobile Internet, such as searches for credit card bills, electronic invoices, nearby restaurants or hotels, news, shopping orders, transportation, and logistics. To improve search efficiency, enterprises need to implement search services for large amounts of data.

Elasticsearch has stronger full-text search capabilities than traditional relational databases. It also provides easy-to-use RESTful APIs and clients in various languages. Only a few milliseconds are required to find matching information from petabytes of structured and unstructured data. Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch features high availability and is easy to use. It helps you quickly build search systems, such as e-commerce commodity or order search systems, application search systems, and customer relationship management \(CRM\) systems. These systems can be integrated into your existing business framework. This way, you can implement complex, condition-based, and fuzzy searches and easily achieve high-performance read and write operations for various types of data. The data include texts, numbers, dates, geographic data \(such as IP addresses\), images, audio, and videos.

## Data intelligence

Various industries, such as gaming, education, and retail, are rapidly developing. In addition to the logs and metrics of underlying systems, large amounts of business data are generated, such as user behavior, driving trajectory, and transaction records. In the context of data-driven operations, in-depth statistical analysis and mining are required for business data. This helps identify the issues and opportunities of upper-level business, assists business decision-making, and truly makes the data valuable.

Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch allows you to query structured data and supports complex data filtering and aggregation-based statistics. You can use Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch to quickly and efficiently analyze various types of data, such as user behavior, attributes, and tags, to accurately identify the desired population. You can use the Kibana service provided by Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch to collect statistics on, classify, and analyze business data and create dashboards. This way, you can extract more value from the data in various scenarios, such as e-commerce, mobile applications, and advertising media.
